ðŸ”¥ Temperature-Time Profile Plotter
This Python script allows you to generate temperature-time plots from simple, human-readable text instructions. Itâ€™s especially useful for visualizing furnace heating/cooling protocols in materials science, ceramics, or thermal treatment experiments. 

âœ¨ Features:
- Easy natural-language input like: `Ramp from 25 to 900C in 10 hours`
- Supports decimals and temperature units like `25C`, `350.4`, etc.
- Automatically calculates and annotates ramp rates, hold durations, total time
- Shows customizable start/end labels and sample code
- Clean matplotlib visuals for scientific reports or lab records
